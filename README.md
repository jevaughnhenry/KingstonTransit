# Kingston Transit Map
My journey to create a transit map for Kingston and its environs, Jamaica.

Steps:
1. Researched the bus routes of the Jamaica Urban Transit Company (JUTC) - https://jutc.gov.jm/bus-routes/
   
   Currently the transit company has 125 routes.

2. Created draft map to get an idea of the extent to be covered - https://metromapmaker.com/?map=5T69N6Zr

3. Created Adobe Illustrator project to create transit map
